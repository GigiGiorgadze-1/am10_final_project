**Requirements**
In the final group project for the Data Visualisation course, you will prepare a 10-minute group presentation where you explore, analyse, and “tell a story” on a data set of interest to you. Your goal should be to create an original project that you would be proud to show off to your friends, potential employers, etc. Presentations will be scheduled for the last day of class.

**Dataset**
We propose using the World Bank Dataset from Kaggle, which offers comprehensive information on various economic, social, and environmental indicators across countries. This dataset is particularly well-suited for examining emerging economies (Eastern Europe, Central Asia, South America) and their development trajectories over the past 10 years.
Scope and Variables

The dataset includes crucial variables such as GDP, Population, Life Expectancy, Unemployment Rate, CO₂ Emissions, and Access to Electricity. These variables allow for an in-depth exploration of the economic, social, and environmental growth of emerging economies.

**Primary Questions and Analytical Focus**
- Economic Growth vs. CO₂ Emissions: How have emerging economies balanced economic growth with environmental impact? We aim to build predictive models for CO₂ emissions and analyse their relationship with GDP growth to assess sustainability practices.
- Economic Health and Employment Trends: What correlations exist between GDP growth and the unemployment rate in emerging economies? This analysis will reveal how economic policies have affected job creation and societal stability.
- Life Expectancy and Population Dynamics: What are the trends in life expectancy in emerging economies, and how do they correlate with population growth and density? This will help identify patterns that could suggest health and well-being improvements or challenges.
- Infrastructure Growth: How has access to electricity evolved over the last decade in emerging economies? This visualisation will highlight disparities in infrastructure development and progress.
- Population Trends: What are the notable demographic shifts in these economies, and how do these shifts relate to resource allocation and economic pressure points?

**Storyline**
Emerging economies are at the forefront of global change, driving growth while facing challenges unique to their stage of development. Through this project, we will leverage the World Bank dataset to explore the multifaceted development journey of these nations. We aim to identify key factors that have contributed to their economic growth, environmental management, societal development, and infrastructure expansion over the last 10 years.

**The Economic-Environmental Balance**
Our project begins by examining the relationship between GDP growth and CO₂ emissions, assessing how emerging economies have managed economic expansion alongside environmental sustainability. We will build predictive models to forecast CO₂ emissions trends and evaluate the trade-offs these nations face.

**Employment and Economic Growth**
We will dive into how GDP trends align with employment data to understand whether growth has translated into meaningful job creation. This analysis will provide insights into which emerging economies have succeeded in using economic growth to bolster employment rates and which have faced challenges.

**Social Development Through Life Expectancy Analysis**
Investigating the evolution of life expectancy will reveal how emerging economies have fared in improving the health and well-being of their populations. We will correlate this with demographic data to identify potential drivers and inhibitors of public health progress.

**Infrastructure Development**
Access to electricity is a foundational indicator of a country's infrastructure and development. By visualising changes over time, we will pinpoint regions that have seen significant progress versus those that still face challenges in reaching comprehensive coverage.

**Demographic Shifts and Population Dynamics**
Visualising population growth over time will allow us to assess the demographic shifts impacting these economies. Understanding these trends is vital for addressing future resource needs, urban planning, and economic strategy.

**Analytical Approach and Visualisation Tools**
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Using Python (Pandas, NumPy) to handle missing values and prepare the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial trends and correlations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Visualisation Tools:
- Tableau: For interactive dashboards showcasing trends and comparisons.
- Plotly: For interactive, detailed exploration of specific trends.

**Visualisation Plan**
Trend Analysis: Line charts to show the evolution of key indicators like GDP, life expectancy, and access to electricity.
Comparative Analysis: Heatmaps and bar charts to compare economic and social metrics across countries.
Correlation Analysis: Scatter plots and bubble charts to visualise relationships between variables such as GDP and CO₂ emissions or GDP and unemployment rates.
Demographic Trends: Interactive visualisations to track population changes over time.
Infrastructure Progress: Maps and line charts to illustrate the expansion of electricity access.

**Expected Insights and Recommendations**
Economic-Environmental Trade-offs: We expect to uncover patterns indicating which policies or economic activities have led to spikes or reductions in CO₂ emissions.
Employment and Prosperity: Identifying how well emerging economies have translated GDP growth into employment gains, providing insights into job market resilience and challenges.
Health and Demographics: Highlighting key drivers behind life expectancy trends and their relation to population growth.
Infrastructure and Energy Access: Visualising the progress made and areas still requiring investment, helping policymakers prioritise development.
Population and Resource Planning: Understanding demographic trends that can influence future economic planning and policy-making.

**Project Timeline**
Week 1: Data selection, formulation of research questions, and preliminary EDA.
Week 2: Data cleaning, refining EDA, and initial visualisation drafts.
Week 3: Finalise visualisations, seek feedback, and prepare a coherent narrative.
Week 4: Presentation rehearsal, iteration based on feedback, and final preparations.
This project aims to deliver a comprehensive analysis of the past decade's developments in emerging economies, providing a data-driven story that showcases their growth, challenges, and future outlook.
